# JavaCalc

JavaCalc is a Java program consisting of three files: Main.java, UserInput.java, and Calculator.java. This program facilitates basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and provides various array-related operations, including sum, mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## Files:

### 1. Main.java:
- Acts as the entry point for the program.
- Prompts the user for two numbers and an array, performs calculations, and displays the results.

### 2. UserInput.java:
- Contains functions for user input, such as acquiring double and integer inputs and an array input function.

### 3. Calculator.java:
- Implements basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Provides array operations such as sum, mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## How to Run:

1. Compile the files:
2. Run the program:


# Functions used:
```bash
javac Main.java UserInput.java Calculator.java

## Functions/Methods:

### Basic Arithmetic:
- `add(double a, double b)`: Addition of two numbers.
- `subtract(double a, double b)`: Subtraction of two numbers.
- `multiply(double a, double b)`: Multiplication of two numbers.
- `divide(double a, double b)`: Division of two numbers.

### Array Operations:
- `sumArray(double[] array)`: Sum of elements in an array.
- `meanArray(double[] array)`: Mean (average) of elements in an array.
- `modeArray(double[] array)`: Mode of elements in an array.
- `medianArray(double[] array)`: Median of elements in an array.
- `varianceArray(double[] array)`: Variance of elements in an array.
- `standardDeviationArray(double[] array)`: Standard Deviation of elements in an array.
